# My Emacs dotfiles

Simply clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d and start emacs. This config uses
el-get and bootstraps itself by first downloading and installing
el-get, and then downloading and installing any required packages.

Also, if you start emacs a second or third time, and el-get is having
trouble loading starter-kit-defuns or some other file, be sure to nuke
~/.emacs.d/.loaddefs.*
El-get tends to mess up loaddefs generation sometimes, deleting them
once should be the proverbial bash on the hood to set it straight.
